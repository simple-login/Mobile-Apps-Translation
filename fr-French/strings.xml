    <!-- FAQ -->
    <string name="frequently_asked_questions">Frequently Asked Questions</string>
    <string name="faq_1_question">What exactly is an email alias?</string>
    <string name="faq_1_answer">Email alias is similar to forward email address: all emails sent to an alias will be forwarded to your inbox.\n\nThanks to SimpleLogin technology, you can also send emails from an alias.\n\nFor your contact, the alias is therefore your email address.</string>
    <string name="faq_2_question">I can use my plus (+) trick to create unlimited email addresses, why do I need SimpleLogin?</string>
    <string name="faq_2_answer">Email subaddressing, also known as the plus (+) trick, is popularized by Gmail and supported by some email services, allows you to create new email addresses by appending "+" to your current email address. Says your email is name@protonmail.com, you can quickly create another address like name+facebook@protonmail.com for Facebook, name+groupon@protonmail.com for Groupon, etc.\n\nThough practical, it has some downsides:\n- You cannot reply from the + address: your real email will appear as the sender.\n- The + trick is well-known and some websites don't allow sign-ups with email addresses that contain +.\n- Using + trick doesn't protect your privacy: one can easily remove the + part to have your real email. If your + address appears in the data breach, your real address is probably also in the hands of spammers. You could check whether your email is leaked using website like have i been pwned\n- By removing the + part, advertisers can link these + addresses together to have your browsing history.\n\nSimpleLogin aliases don't have any of these downsides.\nIn addition SimpleLogin could also help manage your business emails. If you own a domain and don't want to pay a full solution like GSuite, you could add the domain into SimpleLogin and create emails like contact@my-domain.com, partner@my-domain.com with aliases. All our business emails (the @simplelogin.io) are actually aliases.</string>
    <string name="faq_3_question">What is the difference between SimpleLogin and other email forwarding services?</string>
    <string name="faq_3_answer">SimpleLogin is the most advanced email alias solution and is in active development. Here are some differences between SimpleLogin and other email forwarding/alias services:\n\nâ€¢ Fully open-source: both SimpleLogin server and client code (browser extension, JS library, mobile apps) are open-source so anyone can freely inspect and improve the code.\nâ€¢ Covers all major platforms: Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension for desktop, iOS and Android apps for mobile.\nâ€¢ The only email forwarding solution that can be self-hosted, i.e. you could run SimpleLogin on your server. With our detailed self-hosting instructions and most of components running as Docker container, anyone who knows ssh is able to deploy SimpleLogin on their server.\nâ€¢ You can send/reply emails from alias. There's no limits on the number of sends/replies.\nâ€¢ Unlimited bandwidth.\nâ€¢ No ads, no tracker.\nâ€¢ Not just email alias: SimpleLogin is also a privacy-focused and developer-friendly identity provider that:\n   - respects user privacy\n   - is simple to use for developers.\nSimpleLogin offers a privacy-focused alternative to the "Login with Facebook/Google/Apple" buttons.\nâ€¢ Plenty of features: browser extension, custom domain, catch-all alias, OAuth libraries, etc. and much more to come.\nâ€¢ Open roadmap at Trello: you know the exciting features we are working on.</string>
    <string name="faq_4_question">How SimpleLogin is different than temporary email services?</string>
    <string name="faq_4_answer">SimpleLogin alias are permanent as opposed to the temporary email addresses created on services like temp-mail.org, 10minutemail.net, etc.\n\nSimpleLogin also doesn't store the emails, they are stored in your mailbox.\n\nSimpleLogin is simply a different product for a different need.</string>
    <string name="faq_5_question">What is SimpleLogin's business model?</string>
    <string name="faq_5_answer">Our revenue comes only from subscriptions, that means the product will stay ad-free forever.</string>
    <string name="faq_6_question">What happens if SimpleLogin is gone?</string>
    <string name="faq_6_answer">This is probably the hardest question that a company has to answer :)\n\nAs we are using SimpleLogin on a daily basis, for both our personal and professinal usage, in the worst case, we will close registrations for new users so SimpleLogin can only be used by existing users.\n\nFor information, Spamgourmet, a similar email forwarding service has been running for more than 20 years now. Spamgourmet is actually an inspiration for SimpleLogin.\n\nIf all this is still not enough, you can also run a SimpleLogin instance yourself as SimpleLogin code is open-source and we give detailed instructions on how to run it.</string>
    <string name="faq_7_question">What is alias directory or catch-all feature?</string>
    <string name="faq_7_answer">These 2 features both allow you to create alias on-the-fly, meaning you don't have to open SimpleLogin to create a new alias.\n\nEnabling catch-all on your domain allows you to use ANYTHING@my-domain.com as alias with ANYTHING being any word. The only limit is it has to have less than 128 characters.\n\nAlias Directory is similar to catch-all, you can use your_directory+ANYTHING@simplelogin.co as alias. your_directory is the name of the directory you created.</string>
    <string name="faq_8_question">I receive an email forwarded to my personal email from an alias. How can I reply to that email? Do I need to go to SimpleLogin to initiate the reply?</string>
    <string name="faq_8_answer">You can reply directly from your email client. Just click on the "reply" button, the reply will be routed via SimpleLogin and SimpleLogin will make it coming from your alias. Your personal email will stay invisible to the original sender.\n\nTechnically, the From header in your email is replaced by a special alias dynamically generated for each sender. When you reply, your reply is actually sent to this special alias and SimpleLogin will relay the reply back to the sender, making sure the email is sent from your alias. All information about your personal email address is removed during that process.</string>
    <string name="faq_9_question">Are my emails modified?</string>
    <string name="faq_9_answer">No your email content is forwarded as-is, attachments included. SimpleLogin doesn't modify email content and only relies on email headers to do its "magic".</string>
    <string name="faq_10_question">What is a reverse-alias?</string>
    <string name="faq_10_answer">A reverse-alias is a special alias that allows you to send email from your alias.\n\nA reverse-alias is created for each alias you want to send email from and each contact you want to send email to.\n\nWhen you send an email to a reverse-alias from your personal email, the email will be sent from your alias to the contact.</string>
    <string name="faq_11_question">Is email alias permanent?</string>
    <string name="faq_11_answer">As a normal email address, an email alias is always there unless you delete it.</string>
    <string name="faq_12_question">Where is SimpleLogin server located?</string>
    <string name="faq_12_answer">We use UpCloud, a Finland cloud provider. Our server is currently located in its France-Germany datacenter.</string>
    <string name="faq_13_question">I can not find an answer to my question here</string>
    <string name="faq_13_answer">You can find the list of all frequent question/answer on the FAQ page.\n\nIf you don't find the answer there, please send your question to hi@simplelogin.io.\n\nYou can also create an issue on our GitHub Issues.</string>
